/// hazard 6 says not to repeat that: the numbers that size the work here —
/// image extent, tile extent, component count, bit depth, decomposition levels,
/// code-block size — are every one of them read from a codestream that in the
/// primary use case arrives inside a PDF.

/// The JBIG2 lesson that transfers exactly: <b>running out of input is not a
/// backstop.</b> There the MQ decoder reads past the end as <c>0xFF</c> for
/// ever. Here it is the same coder with the same property, and tier-2 adds its
/// own version — a <c>SIZ</c> declaring a huge image and five decomposition
/// levels implies a code-block grid that costs memory to enumerate before a
/// single coded byte is touched. So the ceilings are charged against
/// <em>declared</em> geometry, up front, not against how much data actually
/// arrives.

/// The JBIG2 lesson that does <b>not</b> transfer: there the budget could be

/// dictionary's width and height out of band. A raw J2K codestream carries its
/// own dimensions, so rung 1's anchor is the codestream's own <c>SIZ</c> and the
/// budget is a multiple of it. That bounds amplification (a stream cannot
/// declare a small image and then decode a huge one) without bounding absolute
/// size, which is the same residual JBIG2 documents for the standalone
/// <c>.jb2</c> path. Rung 4 gets the tighter anchor when the PDF entry point
/// arrives with caller-supplied dimensions.
