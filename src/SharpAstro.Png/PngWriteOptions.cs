    /// row is predicted from the unfiltered row above it and so depends on the source image rather
    /// than on anything the previous band produced. That is what makes the whole encode scale rather
    /// than just its deflate: 31.3 MP of 16-bit RGB, measured, 5013 ms in one stream against 1718 at
    /// four fragments, 968 at eight and 825 at twelve.</para>
    /// <para><b>Pick a fixed number rather than the core count.</b> More fragments than there are
    /// cores costs nothing but the size fraction above, so a constant like 8 gets most of the benefit
    /// on a large machine and stays correct, and byte-identical, on a small one. That is the whole
    /// reason to prefer a constant: the file does not change when the hardware does.</para>

    /// path. Neither scales with the fragment count in any way worth tuning.</para>
