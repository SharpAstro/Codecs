/// Receives a TIFF page's pixels strip by strip, instead of as one assembled raster.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> <see cref="TiffReader.Read(System.ReadOnlySpan{byte})"/> returns a
/// COMPLETE raster, so a caller that only wants to convert those bytes into its own representation
/// has both fully resident at once. For a 13228x9354 RGB page that is 354 MiB of intermediate beside
/// the destination -- and the reader already decodes strip by strip, so the whole-raster buffer is an
/// artefact of the API shape rather than anything the format requires.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The span may point straight into the file.</b> When a strip needs no normalisation -- no
/// endian swap (8-bit samples, or a file whose order matches the host) and
/// <see cref="TiffPredictor.None"/> -- and the page is uncompressed, the reader hands over a slice of
/// the input with nothing copied at all. That is the case worth caring about: for an uncompressed
/// page the "decode" is a memcpy, so a caller reading from a memory-mapped file through this
/// interface materialises NEITHER the file bytes nor a raster. Otherwise the span is a reused
/// per-strip scratch buffer.</para>
///
/// <para><b>A tiled page arrives here too, as bands of whole rows.</b> Tiles do not each hold a
/// run of rows, so the reader decodes one ROW of tiles and hands it over as a
/// <c>TileLength</c>-tall band: one contract for both layouts, and a caller need not know which
/// one the file used. The zero-copy case above is therefore strips only -- assembling a band is a
/// copy by definition.</para>
///
/// <para><b>So the span is valid only for the duration of the call.</b> Copy or convert what you
/// need; do not retain it. It is read-only because a mapped view is, and because a shared scratch
/// buffer must not be edited by one strip's handler and observed by the next.</para>
///
/// <para>Implement as a mutable <c>struct</c> and pass it by <c>ref</c> to
/// <see cref="TiffReader.ReadInto{TSink}"/>: the reader takes it as a constrained generic, so a
/// struct sink is neither boxed nor allocated, which matters on a path whose reason for existing is
/// to stop allocating.</para>
