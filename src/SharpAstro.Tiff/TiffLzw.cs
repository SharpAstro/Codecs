/// TIFF's LZW variant (TIFF 6.0 section 13), the other compression a real-world TIFF is likely to use.
///
/// <para><b>It is not GIF's LZW and not raw DEFLATE.</b> Codes are packed <b>MSB-first</b> (GIF packs
/// LSB-first), and the code width grows on the <i>early change</i> schedule: it steps up one code
/// BEFORE the table is actually full -- to 10 bits when the next free code is 511, not 512, and
/// likewise at 1023 and 2047. Both quirks decode plausibly for the first few hundred codes and then
/// diverge, so an implementation that gets either wrong produces a picture that starts correct and
/// turns to noise partway down. libtiff and Photoshop both write early-change, which is what makes it
/// the compatible reading rather than merely one option.</para>
///
/// <para>The table is stored as a prefix chain -- <c>(prefix code, one byte)</c> per entry -- rather
/// than as materialised strings, so adding an entry is O(1) and needs no allocation. Expansion walks
/// the chain, which yields the bytes in reverse, hence the scratch buffer and the backwards fill.</para>
///
/// <para>A predictor, if the file declares one, is applied by the reader AFTER this returns. Nothing
/// here knows about predictors, and LZW plus horizontal differencing is Photoshop's own default pair,
/// so the two must compose rather than one implying the other.</para>
