/// Generic refinement region decoding — ITU-T T.88 §6.3. Reconstructs a bitmap
/// as a set of corrections to a <em>reference</em> bitmap rather than from
/// scratch, which is what lets a lossy page be upgraded to lossless by a second,
/// much cheaper pass.
/// <para>
/// The shape mirrors <see cref="GenericRegionDecoder"/>: one arithmetic decision
/// per pixel, taken against a context built from already-decoded neighbours. The
/// difference is where those neighbours come from — a refinement template reads
/// a few pixels of the bitmap being built <em>and</em> a block of the reference,
/// offset by (<c>GRREFERENCEDX</c>, <c>GRREFERENCEDY</c>). A pixel whose
/// reference neighbourhood is uniform is nearly always the same as the
/// reference, so those decisions cost almost nothing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The same caveat as the generic templates applies, for the same reason: what
/// conformance turns on is <b>which pixels the template reads</b>, not which bit
/// each lands in — permuting the bit positions is a bijection over context
/// values and leaves the coded bytes unchanged. The numbering below still
/// follows T.88 Figures 12-15, because TPGRON's SLTP decision uses hard-coded
/// contexts that name a specific neighbourhood in the spec's numbering.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>TPGRON is refused.</b> Everything else here is confirmed against jbig2dec
/// — both templates, six reference/target relationships, and moved AT pixels —
/// but with TPGRON on, this decoder and jbig2dec part company. What is known,
/// from measurement rather than assumption:
/// </para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>GRTEMPLATE 1 never agrees. Sweeping <em>all 1024</em> possible SLTP
/// context values produced no agreeing candidate, so the SLTP constant is not
/// the cause — something about how the skip itself applies is.</item>
/// <item>GRTEMPLATE 0 agrees on five of six relationships and desynchronises
/// part-way down the sixth, which rules out a simple constant just as
/// firmly.</item>
/// <item>jbig2dec emits no diagnostic either way, so there is no evidence about
/// which side is wrong — and no second oracle available to break the tie.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// So the flag throws. Partial credit is the wrong instinct here: "agrees on
/// five of six" describes a decoder that silently corrupts the sixth, and a
/// caller cannot tell which one it has. TPGRON is an encoder's option, never a
/// requirement, so refusing it costs strictly less than getting it wrong.
