/// <para><b>Why the reader needed this at all.</b> <see cref="TiffLayout.Tiled"/> was write-only --
/// the writer could emit a file this package could not open, which made a tiled export a one-way
/// door and put every tiled file from any other tool out of reach. It also meant the writer could
/// only ever be checked against an outside decoder
/// (<see cref="TiffWriterTiledOracleTests"/>), never round-tripped.</para>
///
/// <para><b>A round trip is not enough on its own here, so it is not the only test.</b> The writer
/// and the reader agree about tile ORDER by construction, so a consistent transpose in both would
/// survive a round trip unnoticed. Three independent checks close that: the same raster written
/// tiled and stripped must decode identically (the stripped path is the covered one); a file
/// written by <b>libtiff</b> must read pixel-for-pixel (an encoder that shares no code with this
/// one, and which pairs its tiles with Predictor 2 -- the case a reader gets silently wrong); and a
/// tiled decode must equal the PNG of the same pixels, which is the golden shape a caller
/// actually compares against.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The trap this path is built around</b> is the predictor. Horizontal differencing
/// restarts at every row of every TILE, and a tile's row is <c>TileWidth</c> wide, not the image's.
/// Running it at image width decodes with no error into a picture that is correct down its first
/// tile column and drifts across the rest -- which is why the libtiff fixture below is written with
