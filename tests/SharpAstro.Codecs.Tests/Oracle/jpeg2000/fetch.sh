# binary rather than compiling from source. OpenJPEG needs CMake, and upstream
# publishes official per-platform builds for exactly the two platforms that
# matter (this dev box and ubuntu-latest CI), so a verified download is both
# less machinery and a stronger guarantee: dev box and CI then run the *same
# bytes*, where two local CMake builds would only run the same source.

# Pinned, for the same reason JXRLIB_COMMIT and STB_SHA256 are pinned: an oracle
# that upstream can move is an oracle that can redefine "correct" underneath a
# green build. The distributed archives carry no upstream checksum file, so the
# SHA-256s below were taken from the assets at pin time and are the contract --
# a mismatch means the release was re-cut or the download was tampered with, and
# either way the right move is to stop, not to carry on with different bytes.
#
# Bumping the version means re-checking every tolerance in the 9/7 irreversible
# tests: the reversible 5/3 path is exact and cannot drift, but the lossy path's
# reference output is whatever this build computes.
