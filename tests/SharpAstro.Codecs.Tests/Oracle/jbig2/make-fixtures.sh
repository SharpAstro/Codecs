# Regenerates the committed JBIG2 fixtures in tests/SharpAstro.Codecs.Tests/Fixtures/jbig2/.
#
# These are real jbig2enc output — bytes this repo did not produce — and they are
# committed (they are well under 130 bytes each) so Jbig2EncoderFixtureTests runs
# in CI with no tooling installed. You only need this script when changing the
# test pattern or refreshing against a newer jbig2enc.
#
# Requires jbig2enc's CLI, which is packaged as `jbig2`:
#     apt-get install -y jbig2
# On Windows, run this inside WSL:
#     wsl -- bash tests/SharpAstro.Codecs.Tests/Oracle/jbig2/make-fixtures.sh
#
# Licence: jbig2enc is Apache-2.0. Its *source* could not be a port source for
# this Unlicense repo; its *output* is data — a rendering of a pattern authored
# here — and carries no such constraint. Same distinction as every other
# reference implementation in ROADMAP-pdf-codecs.md.
