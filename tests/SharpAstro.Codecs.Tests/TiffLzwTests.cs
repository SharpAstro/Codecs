/// <summary>
/// TIFF LZW decode. The two things an implementation gets subtly wrong are both covered here, because
/// both decode PLAUSIBLY at first and only diverge later: codes are packed MSB-first (GIF's LZW packs
/// them LSB-first), and the code width grows on the <i>early change</i> schedule -- one code before
/// each power of two. Get either wrong and a strip decodes correctly for a few hundred codes and then
/// turns to noise, so a fixture must be long enough to cross a width boundary or it proves nothing.
///
/// The encoder lives in the test because <see cref="TiffWriter"/> does not emit LZW, so there is no
/// round-trip through the library that could reach this code. It mirrors the decoder's width schedule
/// deliberately -- that makes this a round-trip test, which cannot by itself prove the schedule matches
/// libtiff. What pins that is the real-file check: a Photoshop-written LZW TIFF decodes to a clean
/// image (verified against an independent implementation), and it would not if the schedule were off.
