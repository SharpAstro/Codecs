/// <para>
/// This exists because of the failure mode called out in <c>CLAUDE.md</c>: <i>a
/// silently skipped oracle is not a passing oracle.</i> Every oracle harness in
/// this repo degrades to a skip so a clean clone still goes green, which is
/// right for a dev box and actively misleading in CI — a workflow that installs
/// the tool and then quietly skips the tests anyway looks identical to one that
/// runs them. Setting <c>REQUIRE_ORACLES=1</c> (CI does) converts that silence
/// into a red build.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// JBIG2 is the first harness wired up this way. The JXR and jpegenc oracles
/// still use the older return-pass idiom and never run in CI at all; they can
/// adopt this gate once their binaries are obtainable there.
